## Overview
The Online Movie Database Management System is a Java-based application enabling users to interact with a movie database. It provides functionalities such as movie browsing, watchlist management, and user authentication. The project is divided into two phases: the basic implementation focusing on core features, and the advanced implementation introducing enhanced functionalities and user experience.This project gives information about the online movie database management system
Information is as follows:

### Features:
- The title, director, releaseYear, runningTime for movies
- The arraylist of movies for movie database
- The username and password for user
- **User Management**: Secure login and registration system with data persistence.
- **Movie Database**: Core functionalities to add, remove, and browse movies.
- **Watchlist Management**: Personalized watchlist for users to track their favorite movies.
- **Exception Handling**: Robust error handling to ensure application stability.
- **Advanced Data Operations**: Utilization of Java Collections Framework and Stream API for efficient data handling and operations.
- **File-based Data Storage**: Use of file operations for storing user and movie data.

## Team Members and Contributions
- **Aykhan Guliyev**: Focused on the development of user interfaces for movie browsing and user authentication. Worked extensively on `User.form`, `MovieBase.form`, and `MovieBase.java`, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user interaction with the system through Java Swing.
- **Ayyam Aghali**: Dedicated to backend development for user management. Contributed to `User.java` and `User.form`, implementing the logic for user registration, login, and data persistence using file operations.
- **Riad Bagishov**: Key developer for the core functionalities in `Movie.java` and `User.java`. Primarily worked on crafting the main methods in both classes, laying the foundation for the application's runtime behavior and integrating key functionalities like user login process and initializing the movie database.



### Getting started:
To run the project on your local machine, folow these steps:

1. Clone the repository into your local machine:
[https://github.com/AyyamAghali/PP2-CRN-10377-Assigment2-Final_Project_Team-EN_Passant_Engineers.git](https://github.com/AyyamAghali/PP2-CRN-10377-Assigment2-Final_Project_Team-EN_Passant_Engineers.git)

2. You need to pull first from the main branch and use the last updated project. 

3. If you want to access the database in your localhost, you should initialize in PostgreSQL database "movie-local" user to "movie", password to "1234";
